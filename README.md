# kafka-example
A simple Kafka app with easy to set up configuration

## Problem to solve:

When we need to deliver a new feature where we will need to use Kafka broker to communicate <br />
sometimes we will need to set up our own local env.
It can be painful to find proper Kafka and Zookeeper configuration. <br />
So this repo can solve your problem, cause everything you will need to do is run just a single command.
It will create Kafka, Zookeeper instances and WebUI that helps you to monitor new events and their messages
Enjoy :)

## Hot to run
