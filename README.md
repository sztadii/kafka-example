# kafka-example
A simple Kafka app with easy to set up configuration

## Problem to solve:

During development new feature where we will need to use Kafka broker to communicate we will need to set up own local env.
It can be painful to find proper Kafka and Zookeeper configuration.
So this repo can solve your problem, cause everything you will run just with one command.
It will create Kafka, Zookeeper instances and WebUI that helps you to monitor new events, and their messages
Enjoy :)

## Hot to run
